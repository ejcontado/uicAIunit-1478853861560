    <h1>Instruction for how to use angular</h1>
    <p>Let's use <b>wulfdist_ang15</b> as example, it is same for bower update(by using dist). There are four ways to support angular with wulf, you can decide to choose one as you need:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>wulfdist_ang15/js/wulf.angular.tlp.min.js: it includes all angular js files and all template files.</li>
        <li>wulfdist_ang15/js/wulf.angular.min.js: It includes all angular js files but no template files. it needs to work with template folder together.</li>
        <li>wulfdist_ang15/js/components/*/*.tlp.min.js: JS file + template file only for seperated component</li>
        <li>wulfdist_ang15/js/components/*/*.js: Only JS file for seperated component, it needs to work with template folder together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tips for using template folder if you choose option #2 or #4:<br>
        The templateUrl is relative path, that is wf/ng-template/*/*.html. Please copy the template folder to the correrct path if template is needed.
